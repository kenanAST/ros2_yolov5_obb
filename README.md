# ROS2 YOLOv5_OBB

This repository contains a ROS2 implementation of the YOLOv5_OBB object detection algorithm. YOLOv5_OBB is an extension of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm that specifically focuses on detecting objects with oriented bounding boxes (OBB). The implementation leverages the power of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) framework to enable seamless integration with robotic systems.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv5_OBB algorithm
- Supports detection of objects with oriented bounding boxes
- ROS2 node implementation for easy integration with ROS2-based robotic systems

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- ROS2 (tested with Galactic)
